        <b>1. Introduction</b>
\nscc values the trust our users and customers place in us when they give us access to their personal data. The Privacy Policy describes how we work to maintain that trust and protect that information.
In particular, this Privacy Policy details our collection, use and disclosure of personal and non-personal data you give to scc when you access or use scc’s online and/or mobile services and websites, and software provided by scc on or in connection with such services or websites (collectively, the “Site”).
        \n<b>1.1 Personal Data and Non-Personal Data</b>
\nPersonal data (“Personal Data”) refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and non-personal data (“Non-Personal Data”) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual. Please note that at all times scc will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. Where this Privacy Policy refers to “information” or “your information” this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.
        \n<b>1.2 Changes to the Privacy Policy</b>
\nPlease review the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to determine when this Privacy Policy was last amended. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the “Last Updated” date indicated above. By using the Site or providing information to us following such changes, you will have accepted the amended Privacy Policy. If scc is going to use Personal Data collected through the Site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, then scc will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on scc’s Site for 30 days prior to such use or by other means as required by law.
        \n<b>1.3 scc approach to privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b>
\nPlease note this Privacy Policy describes, in a comprehensive manner, how scc processes your data. For more information on scc’s approach to privacy and GDPR
        \n<b>2. Information Collected</b>
\nYou provide different types of information in order for scc to provide our services, products and features to you.

        \n<b>2.1 Information You Provide to Scc</b>
\n– From Your Account
We collect data from you when you create an Scc account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, complete an Scc Assessment, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Site. This may include, but is not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Employers through Scc and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you, which you answer.

\n– Through Your Activity on Scc
In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Site, Scc may collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device and actions taken on the Site, including, but not limited to, your resume, your searches on Scc, the titles of jobs you search, click on or apply to, where those jobs are located, salary interest or experience, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (where indicated), your activity time on the Site and each page, page views, clicks, taps, session activity, browser type, operating system, type of device, MAC address, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site. When you submit a photo to Job Spotter, this may include the provision of the location data of where the photo was taken. Scc seeks your consent at the time of such provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.
\n– When Providing Employer Information
If you are an Employer, Scc may request that you provide certain Personal Data to Scc in order to verify your account. This information may include, but may not be limited to, your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill, the name and email address of an Employer representative.
This information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order. In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information). Please note that Scc only has access to the last four digits of Employer credit card numbers, and does not store full credit card numbers.
        \n<b>2.2 Storage of Your Information</b>
\nScc shall retain users’ Personal Data to the extent such retention is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. In particular, Scc shall not retain Personal Data for any longer than necessary for the purposes of performing the processing outlined in this Privacy Policy.
If you create an Scc account, your information may be collected and stored in a manner that connects to your account email address. Scc may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code. For example, while using a mobile device to access Scc, Scc may provide a Job Seeker with relevant job postings that are located within the same zip code as where this activity is taking place. The collection of this data is solely used in accordance with the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy, to the extent applicable.
Scc may also store the information detailed in this section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Scc has a relationship with. Such storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.
        \n<b>2.3 What Personal Data is Required</b>
\nScc will indicate to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Scc services or features to you. Where Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.
        \n<b>3. Limitation of Use or Disclosure of Personal Data</b>
        \n<b>3.1 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Close a Job Seeker Account</b>
\nWhen a Job Seeker closes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account name, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, job alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account. If the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to the Job Seeker again. Please also note that closing your Job Seeker account may result in you losing access to all Scc products and the ability to utilize the “Log in with Scc” feature found on certain third party sites.
Scc reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement). A closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Scc systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker’s original account name. When the Job Seeker presses the close account button on the dashboard, Scc will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.
If a Job Seeker wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Scc, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.
        \n<b>3.2 Where an Employer Wants to Close an Employer Account</b>
\nEmployers may close an account at any time by contacting us. Please note that Scc must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law. Alternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Scc, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, and such a request will be processed in accordance with applicable rules.
        \n<b>3.3 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Delete a Job Application</b>
\nIf a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on Scc’s Site, they are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application. For job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through Scc (including the use of an Scc Apply button) to an Employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an Employer; 2) we may direct you to that Employer for Personal Data deletion requests where that Personal Data is held by that Employer; and 3) Scc depends on the Employer or the Employer’s agent to provide Scc with the correct destination for all applications.
        \n<b>3.4 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Scc Are Incorrect</b>
\nIn the event that the electronic destination provided to Scc is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application. Scc has no liability for such applications.
